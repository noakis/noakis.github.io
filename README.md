# noakis.github.io

DESCRIPTION:

Portfolio Project:

This site includes a Home page with photo, small bio, video, and contact links, and a Projects page that shows three projects I worked on as part of MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding Program.

HOW TO RUN:

. Clone the repository into your local environment and open the index.html file.

. Follow the direct link at the bottom.

ROADMAP FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

It needs more styling; and more projects I develop will have to be added in time.
